==================
Be Free!
==================

Searching for an flv player that could be used freely in all aspects and open source was 
a hard job. So I just decided to work on a basic player that had the most important 
features found in others players.

Thats the story of how Jaris was born.

==================
License
==================

Jaris is licensed under GPL and LGPL, meaning that you could use it commercially. 
What we ask for is that any improvements made to the player should be taken back to jaris flv website 
so that any one could enjoy the new improvements or features also. In this way everyone could 
help to maintain an up to date tool that adapts to todays multimedia demands. 
Using sourceforge.net you could send a patch http://sourceforge.net/projects/jaris/.

Enjoy a totally free player ;-)
